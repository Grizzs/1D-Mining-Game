This application was one of my home works for the week. The inicial task was simple but I made it hard for myself, I used classes to improve my understanding about them. Took me about 3 hours to finish this but it actually changed my view on classes.

It's a very simple game where you are supposed to mine a cave to find a diamond
The cave is a list you can only mine from left to right You'll find bombs on your way(max 3) and if after you mine a rock youre going to face that bomb you lose 
But if you place a block right on the spot where that last block is that bomb will turn into a rock aswell and you'll not die :D 
But theres not that many rocks you can use (max 6) and if you run out of them, then o7 You also can't go beyond the limit of the list, if the list is set to 40 you cannot go beyond that
